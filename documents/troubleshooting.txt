APEX DATA-BRIDGE (ADB) - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

1. ERROR CODE: 'E-SYNC-FAIL'
Description: This error occurs when the ADB cannot synchronize with the source database for more than 5 minutes.
Resolution:
- Check network connectivity between the ADB appliance and the source DB server.
- Verify that port 5432 is open on the firewall.
- A temporary workaround is to restart the 'apex-sync' service using the CLI command: 'adb-cli restart sync'.

2. PERFORMANCE: SLOW DATA TRANSFER
Description: Transfer speeds drop below 10MB/s.
Resolution:
- Ensure the ADB is not placed on a shared network segment.
- Check for 'Packet Loss' warnings in the main dashboard.
- We recommend using direct fiber connection for optimal performance.

3. DEVICE UNRESPONSIVE
Description: The physical unit's status light is solid red.
Resolution:
- Perform a hard reset by pressing the recessed button on the back panel for 10 seconds. The light should flash orange.
- If the light remains solid red, the unit requires hardware replacement.
