APEX DATA-BRIDGE (ADB) - INTEGRATION NOTES

1. API AUTHENTICATIONq
- All API requests to the ADB must be authenticated using a Bearer Token.
- The token is generated in the Admin Console under 'Settings -> Security -> API Tokens'.
- The token has a lifespan of 24 hours by default.

2. WEBOOK CONFIGURATION
- The ADB can send webhooks for specific events (e.g., 'sync_completed', 'sync_failed').
- To configure, send a POST request to '/api/v1/webhooks' with a JSON payload specifying the 'event_type' and 'callback_url'.
- The ADB will expect a 200 OK response from your callback URL within 3 seconds; otherwise, it will retry up to 3 times.

3. DATA FORMAT SUPPORT
- The current ADB firmware (v2.1) supports ingestion of CSV, JSON, and Parquet formats.
- XML support was deprecated in v1.5 and is no longer available.
- For JSON files, the root element must be an array of objects.
